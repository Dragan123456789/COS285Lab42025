How our Lab4 works is by taking in all the numbers and putting them into a list named data and making a new list that is linked to MyBinarySearch named tree. 
We call the method buildTree from MyBinarySearch which will build the tree based on the binary format. From there we print the tree to have a visual.
Then we search the tree with selected values of 12 and 13 and discover if they are in the tree.
MyBinarySearch class is straight forward enough, with the additon of bfsPrintTree along with looking for the values in the tree .
It will recursivly look though either the left or right subtree to see if the chosen value is found.
